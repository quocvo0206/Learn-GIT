Stay at home to save  lives. That is the warning from the UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who says it's "not a request but an instruction" to the British people, to beat the coronavirus pandemic. He says any relaxation of social distancing rules will lead to more deaths.  684 more people have died in the UK in the last 24 hours.  Among them were two NHS nurses, each leaving behind 3 children.   The Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he'll remain in self isolation because he still has a temperature, a week after testing positive for Covid-19.  NHS and other frontline staff are facing huge difficulties â€” one intensive care consultant has been keeping a video diary charting the pressures they are facing.  Clive Myrie presents BBC News at Ten coverage from Health Editor Hugh Pym, Political Correspondent Vicki Young and Health Correspondent Catherine Burns.
